# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
This C-program prints a solution to a scrambled rubiks cube.

Currently under development. If you would like to test it with a given scramble you must be familiar with the SPEFZ-sticker scheme and also be comfortable with editing and compiling C-code. I will make this usable for beginners later.
